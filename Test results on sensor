There are two types of output in the rain sensor, namely  
1. Analog output 
2. Digital Output 
1.Analog Output: -In this output terminal output voltage is 
5V when no rain is detected and varies up to 1.8V as 
intensity of rain increases in a linear manner. This terminal 
output   is used to check the intensity of rain 
2.Digital Output: -In this output terminal output voltage is 
5V when no rain is detected and suddenly falls to 0V at 
the very moment when rain is detected 
TEST RESULTS USED FOR THE PROJECT 
In this case for medium intensity of water on the sensor 
surface the voltage varies from 2V to 4V. Considering 
V(ref) 
Values of ADC 0V and 5V for Vref(-) and Vref(+) 
respectively. 
The threshold value of a voltage was chosen to be 2.9V 
for which the output of ADC was 90H.
