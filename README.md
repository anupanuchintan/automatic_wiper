An automatic windshield wiper system is an 
innovative solution designed to enhance vehicle safety and 
convenience by automating the operation of wipers. Unlike 
traditional systems, this advanced system detects rainfall in real
time and activates the wipers automatically. Once the rain stops, 
the system deactivates the wipers. By integrating rain sensors, 
microcontrollers, and electromechanical actuators, this project 
aims to develop a cost-effective and reliable wiper mechanism that 
responds dynamically to changing weather conditions. This 
technology provides a hands-free solution, improving visibility and 
overall driving experience.
