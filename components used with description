1.8051 Ddevelopment board with AT89S52 MC mounted on it

AT89S52: - The AT89S52 is an 8051-based microcontroller known 
for its simplicity and reliability. It operates using an 8-bit architecture and is 
widely used in embedded systems. The microcontroller includes the 
following key features 
DETAILS: - 
4KB Flash Memory: Stores the program code.  
128 Bytes of RAM: For temporary data storage.  
32 I/O Pins: Configured for input or output operations. 
3 Timers/Counters: For timing and control tasks. 
Interrupt System: Manages priority tasks efficiently 

2.Rain Sensor- A rain sensor is a switching device which is activated by rainfall. 
There are two main applications of rain sensors. First is a water conservation device 
connected to an automatic water irrigation system. The second is a device used to 
support the automatic mode of windscreen wipers. The rain sensor works on the 
principle of total internal reflection. An infrared light shone at a 45-degree angle on a 
clear area of the windshield is reflected and is sensed by the sensor inside the car. 
When it rains, the wet glass causes the light to scatter, and a lesser amount of light gets 
reflected to the sensor. 


3.ADC0808: - In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, 
A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a 
sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a 
digital signal. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement such as 
an electronic device that converts an analog input voltage or current to a 
digital number representing the magnitude of the voltage or current. 
Typically, the digital output is a two's complement binary number that is 
proportional to the input, but there are other possibilities.


4.Motor Driver(L298N): - PWM, or pulse width modulation is a 
technique which allows us to adjust the average value of the voltage thatâ€™s 
going to the electronic device by turning on and off the power at a fast rate. 
The average voltage depends on the duty cycle, or the amount of time the 
signal is ON versus the amount of time the signal is OFF in a single period. 
So, depending on the size of the motor, we can simply connect a 
microcontroller PWM output to the base of transistor or the gate of a 
MOSFET and control the speed of the motor by controlling the PWM output. 
The low power microcontroller PWM signal switches on and off the gate at 
the MOSFET through which the high-power motor is driven.

5.Buffer (CD4050): - A digital buffer (or a logic buffer) is an 
electronic circuit element used to copy a digital input signal and isolate 
it from any output load. For the typical case of using voltages as logic 
signals, a logic buffer's input impedance is high, so it draws little 
current from the input circuit, to avoid disturbing its signal. 
The digital buffer is important in data transmission between connected 
systems. Buffers are used in registers (data storage device) and 
buses (data transferring device). To connect to a shared bus, a tri
state digital buffer should be used, because it has a high impedance 
("inactive" or "disconnected") output state (in addition to logic low and 
high).
