There are a few challenges that we faced during this project, one 
of them is the sensitivity of the rain sensor. The output of the sensor 
we used is not of very wide range, so the detection of rain 
intensity is not very clear in this case. But with sensors with 
sensitivity and a good range of output, multiple levels of rain and 
wiper speed can be implemented providing a smooth marketable 
product. In this project only two levels of rain are detected, low and 
high.
